				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>The entities known as Sloths are beings that are believed to have appeared sometime
				around 3000 years ago. Studying them is very difficult because they are extraordinarily intelligent,
				ultimately leaving little known about their kind. The most modern hypothesis suggests that the true form
				of a sloth is different than what is seen today. It further argues that this change happened in 
				order for sloths to observe us better.</p>
				<p>Research suggests the current form of the sloth is in response to human defensive mechanisms. The 
				slow movement and lax behavior of sloths creates the illusion that they are harmless, as well as 
				non-sentient. While their intentions are a mystery, there have been no known cases of fatalities
				related to the sloths. Because of their peaceful history but unknown motives, they are currently
				placed in the Fennec threat tier.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="varieties">
				<h2>Social Structure</h2>
				<p>There are two relatively peaceful factions of sloths: Two-Toed and Three-Toed Sloths. Each faction conists of
				several clans. There does exist an hierarchy within these structures, however how the leaders are determined
				is still unknown.</p>
				<p>Of the three-toed sloths, the most common clan is the brown-throated sloth. The brown-throated sloths are known for having a polygynous mating system,
				meaning the males have multiple partners while the females have only one partner. The pale throated sloth 
				is often mistaken for brown-throated sloths, with the main physical difference being the appearance of the throat.
				The maned sloth is noted primarily for having a mane, unlike the others. Finally, the pigmy sloth is the 
				rarest of these, found exlusively on the Isla Escudo de Veraguas, an island off of Panama. The pigmy sloths 
				are considered critically endangered, and as such recon teams have very little opportunity to study them. It 
				is thought that they may be the societal elite of the three-toed clan.</p>
				<p>Of the two-toed sloths, there are the Linnaeus' and Hoffmann's varieties. Of the two factions, the two-toed sloths
				are thought to be inferior to the three-toed sloths. The Linnaeus' sloth is unique in that when confronted by a predator,
				they will rear on their hind legs and run backwards to escape. This behavior often results in injuries for the sloth, however,
				as they don't look where they are going and can crash into rocks, trees, or other obstacles. The Hoffmann's sloth is 
				also interesting in that it stays contained in roughly the same area. Because of this, the Hoffmann's sloth may spend 
				the majority of its life only between roughly 25 trees.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="intelligence">
				<h2> Intelligence </h2>
				<p>Reports indicate that sloths are extremely intelligent. In early days when they were more active, puzzles disguised as "artifacts" were
				left out in the jungles. The sloths seeing these began solving them to unlock their contents, which was often gibberish with no definite 
				pattern or answer to provoke their curiosity further. From these experiments, it has been concluded that to sloths, concepts such as quantum 
				mechanics and advanced math/engineering are relatively trivial to them, which raises more questions about why they are here. It is clear that 
				they may be capable of near, or even faster, than light travel, making discovering the origin where they came from far more difficult.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="physiology">
				<h2>Physiology</h2>
				<p>Most sloths can be 60-80 cm and weigh between 3.6-7.7 kg. Sloths have distinctively long limbs and round heads with small ears.
				Rather than having 7 cervical vertebrae like most mammals, two-toed sloth have six and three-toed sloths have nine, allowing
				them to have 270 degrees of head rotation. Unlike nearly all other animals, the sloths fur grows away from their extremities
				to provide protection from rain while hanging upside down. Notably, sloths have a symbiotic relationship with algae in their
				fur, giving the algae a place to grow in return for camouflage.</p>
				<p>Sloths have color vision, but have poor visual acuity. With bad hearing as well, they must rely on smell and touch in order
				to find food for themselves. Because of their low metabolic rates this does not pose a problem for them, as much of their time
				is spent sleeping or observing humans and other animals around them. They are also capable of being underwater for up to 40 minutes
				due to their ability to slow their metabolism even further.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="psychology">
				<h2>Psychology</h2>
				<p>The psychology of sloths is one of the largest mysteries yet to be solved. While early tests have shown they clearly are smarter
				than they seem at first glance, researchers are baffled at why they have chosen the form they exist in today. While their lifestyle
				gives them the ability to spend all day observing and collecting information, this has left them almost defenseless if they are cornered
				by predators, as their main defense is hanging from trees. It has been suggested that their kind are extremely interested in the 
				search for more knowledge, even risking their lives if it meant furthering what they know. It is to be noted that the sloth's observation
				and research attempts became far less invasive since the 1930s immediately following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War">Great Emu War</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="diet">
				<h2>Diet</h2>
				<p>Sloths learn what to eat from licking the lips their mothers when they are babies. This was confirmed by
				the accidents related to the <a href="./notAuthorized.html">Carnivorous Sloth experiments</a>. Left alone, two-toed sloths
				will eat insects, fruits, leaves, small lizards, and carrion. On the other hand, three-toed sloths only eat leaves. Because 
				leaves provide little nutrients, sloths have large stomachs with several sections for symbiotic bacteria to break down the leaves.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="religion">
				<h2>Religion</h2>
				<p>Sloths appear to consider religion extremely important. While specific details are unable to be made out, the religion
				evolves around trees, as their physical anatomy is perfectly designed to work with them. It is unclear what the sloths consider
				the trees to be to them, and it is only known that they are a central pillar for their religion. Unfortunately, many
				sloths have ended up dying due to mistaking power lines as artificial trees created by human kind. Sloths are so dedicated to
				trees, that often times even after they have passed, they are found to remain clinging to the trees and not letting go.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="approach">
				<h2>Approachability</h2>
				<p>While sloths should be treated with caution, in general there are no immediate threats from being in the presence of them. Previous tests
				have shown that current mathematical and scientific findings are still trivial to the sloths, so there is no need for hiding
				such information from them. Because most people do not know the truth about them, humans and sloths are sometimes found to co-exist with
				eachother. It should be noted to remain calm when dealing with sloths, however, as they can smell fear and in some cases have been found 
				to act erratically when in such a scenario. It must also be noted to never take your eyes off of sloths in your immediate vicinity, as
				breaking line of site with them for several seconds have sometimes resulted in them inexplicably appearing extremely close to the test subject in
				a rather short amount of time.</p>
