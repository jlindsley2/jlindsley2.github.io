			<p> Welcome to my website. This summer of 2018, I made goals to familiarize myself with Web Design, as well as with Python to supplement my
			computer science degree(Which so far has only been learning Java).</p>
			<p> This site currently serves to host my experiments when I get ideas to do a project.</p>
			<br>
		</p> Update for 2019: I feel I have some basics down for web design. I've made small python programs but nothing major. If you're wondering when I'll clean up this home page and make it look fancy,
		it probably won't happen too soon. I'm more of a functionality guy.
