			<p> Welcome to my website. This summer of 2018, I made goals to familiarize myself with Web Design, as well as with Python to supplement my
			computer science degree(Which so far has only been learning Java).</p>
			<p> This site currently serves to host my experiments when I get ideas to do a project.</p>
