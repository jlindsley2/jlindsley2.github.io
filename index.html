			<p> Welcome to my website. In the summer of 2018, I made goals to familiarize myself with some website basics to supplment my CS education(Which so far had only been Java and C).</p>
			<p> This site hosts some of the experiments(mostly geared towards the functionality side), although I did create some very basic view styles. Everything on this site was
			written by me, one line at a time. In hindsight I probably should have just used bootstrap for everything.</p>
