			<p>This is the first project I actually tried to do a decent job on.</p>
			<p>This was my first serious time I used JavaScript seriously. Coming from Java, the biggest challenge was actually dealing with the
			asynchronicity of the language. I was used to Java loading everything, pausing/asking for input, then continuing on immediately when that
			waiting period was over. It was very awkward trying to make "states"(e.g. player's turn, bot's turn, won/loss game). Thankfully this project
			was small-scale enough that I did not need to use more of a Model-View-Controller architecture.</p>
			<p>And yes, I used Bootstrap EXCLUSIVELY for their fancy buttons.</p>
