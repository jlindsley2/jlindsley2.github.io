			<p>As a Computer Science student, I finally came around to learning some basics for web development. I took inspiration
			from a personal site a friend of mine had made, where it clearly had things out of the ordinary in it(although his was
			less obvious).</p>
			<br>
			<p>I made the sloth-related pages in two days, everything from scratch(So I'd know why to use a framework in the future). On the first
			day, I had just finished learning basic CSS the day before, and I set up the github parts. I then laid out all of the HTML and CSS that
			was used(barring minor changes). On the second day, having learned javascript over the past two weeks, I learned a few basics for jQuery
			in order to set up my Tin Foil Hat Mode&trade; for the sloth article.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I actually don't like sloths very much. They're pretty sketchy if you ask me, hence why I chose it. Looking at it in 2019, I am unsure of what was going
				through my head when I decided it would be a good first project. Either way it was interesting to make.
