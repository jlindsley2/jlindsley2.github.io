			<p>The L-Ratio, or Lindsley Ratio, is designated based on the physical threat exhibited by an entity.</p>
			<p>The ratio attempts to simulate chances of winning a physical confrontation against an unarmed human. With this
			in mind, a human has a ratio of 1, which is considered the base. This scale, however, is only temporary
			as a linear measurement is not ideal for measuring extreme cases. For this, a logarithmic approach has been suggested.</p>
